damanges, or any other such obligations.  It is merely to provide 
credit to the original author of the template. 

At present, the template supports the following tests:
cpu	-   Should result in CPU (% utilisation, not load average) graphs
fans	-   At present, no alerting, just lists fan speed, graph support may 
	    come
keys	-   By default warns 2 weeks before keys expire, critical 1 day before 
	    keys expire. Warning threshold has been tested and works
memory	-   Should result in graphs by default, should warn/alert if utilisation
	    hits threshold set on device
power	  - Warns if power supply missing, critical if power supply is fauly or
	    if AC power is not connected to the power supply - not tested
queue	  - Intended for NCV-based graphs of Queue utilisation and Work Queue
	    messages - I've never seen Queue utilisation be anything but 0
raid	  - Should warn if a physical drive is rebuilding, or be critical if
	    a physical drive has failed - not tested
resources - Intended for NCV graphs of disk io, open files, and mail transfer
	    threads
temp	  - Should warn at 30 deg celsius, alert at 50, should be a devmon
	    temp graph, but it may be hitting a devmon bug
updates   - Lists number of updates received for each service, and number of
	    failed updates. May get a graph? Thresholds? Alerts?
