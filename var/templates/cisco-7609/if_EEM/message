TABLE:rrd(DS:ds0:ifInEps:GAUGE)
Ifc name|Total Errors in|Delta Errors in
{ifName}{ifEemActive.color}{ifAliasBox}{ifEemActive.errors}|{ifInErrors}|{ifInEps.color}{ifInEps}{ifInEps.errors}

Note: 
Error rates are per second, averaged over a 60 second interval.
EEM errors match up with triggers set in EEM scripts using the inInErrors delta counter.
The EEM script on the routers watch the counter and triggers the script when it crosses 10 errors.
Then it holds the path out of OSPF till the error count drops back to Zero. This test will go yellow when
one error is counted then turn red at 10. This is so we can see events leading up to the script
triggering then monitor till it clears.
Alert Will also trigger when the interface discription is set to ****EEM Interface SHUTDOWN. This will catch EEM scripts that have not reset the interface.
