This template is very similar to compaq-server, except it doesn't try and
enumerate spare phyiscal drives (which fails if they are not present, causing
all the test to fail), and doesn't try and check the controller status (which
doesn't work for me on newer hpasm versions). Use this test on servers which
don't have any hot spares available in the SmartArry configuration.
