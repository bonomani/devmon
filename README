Devmon VERSION 0.21.06.06, fork at SF version 0.3.1-beta1 r256
======================================================================

THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL VERSION from the original developers:
- Look at SourceForge version for it !
- Previous modified devmon version in this repo were reported
  (in 2017) to be less stable than the SF one...
- Use it at your own risks !

SEE END OF FILE for detailled  STATUS and ROADMAP!

======================================================================

0.21.06.09 Changes
New features
- CPU revamp (Cisco, Huawei), mainly the "uptime" part
  - Reboot cause analysis with a auto disable timer 
  - Better Uptime value, calculation with (snmp and system oid)
- Threshold automatch acccept multiple value
   - We can have not multiple empty (automatch) threshold for an oid
   - Empty threshold of the current color is prefered  
Bug resolved
- MATH transform with constant (without other deps oids)
- TSWITCH calc
- Perl 5.28 compatibility
- Threshold calculation 
- Custom threshold in hosts.cfg should overide other
- BEST threshold can override herited error
And some more !!!

 What is Devmon ?
---------------------------------------

  Devmon is a Perl software that uses SNMP to monitor, graph and alert 
  on host information

 What are Devmon's prerequisites?
---------------------------------------

  In order for Devmon to do anything useful, you will need
  a machine capable of running the Perl interpreter, which
  is used to execute the Devmon code.  

  In addition, you will need a machine (either the same machine 
  running Devmon, or a different one) runing either the Hobbit/Xymon 
  or BigBrother monitoring program, which displays the messages
  that Devmon generates.  

  Finally, you will need your to have your Hobbit/Xymon or BigBrother 
  program set up to monitor at least  one host that Devmon has 
  a template for.   Only then will Devmon be able to poll a 
  remote host and display the results.  For more information on 
  Devmon's template system, please consult the TEMPLATES file
  located in the docs directory.

 How do I install Devmon?
---------------------------------------

  Detailed instructions are available in the docs/INSTALLATION
  file.  A single-node installation merely requires you to untar
  the Devmon tarball to a suitable location, modify the config
  file appropriately, and start the Devmon daemon.  

  A multi-node installation requires you to do all of the above
  on each node in the cluster, as well as set up a MySQL database
  to facilitate communication between nodes.

 What are Devmon templates?
--------------------------------------

  Devmon can monitor a virtually unlimited number of different 
  device types, by allowing a user to define a template for
  each test to be conducted on a particular device type.
  For instance, a 'cpu' test on a Cisco 2950 switch is its own 
  template, while a 'if_load' test on the same switch is an
  entirely different template. A must read: the docs/TEMPLATES file!

Thanks for all the work done and also all patch/ideas submitted !
Special thanks to this fork version contributors
- W. Nelis
- Stef Coene
- Coec (Github name)

And all previous devmon admins and devs: 
- Henrik Stoerner
- Steve Aiello
- Dan Vande More
- Craig Boyce
- Buchan Milne

This is a work in progress, changes can occur without notice ....

FEEDBACK ALWAYS APPRECIATED: use the github ISSUES to communicate even it is not a bug !

===========================================================================================================================================

Major changes after fork
. All patches from Sourceforge are integrated in this realease (some with adaptation)
- Improved User-Friendliness 
  - Add the 'Blue' color for test that are 'Disabled' and for fun !
  - Error reporting

- Error propagation as "core" concept  

- Multiple error messages and threshold for each oid color !
 
- New transforms:
  - COLTRE     : To collect data when there are "parent" oid values   
  - SORT       : To sort in an increasing order (num or txt, default = txt)
                 oid values. The result (the new oid values) are 
                 int indexes corresponding to the position of the source
                 oid values in the sort.
                 The results are a int between 1 and n 
                 (n is the number of element in the branch oid) 
                 It can be used to 'reindex' an oid if use in conjonction with
                 the CHAIN transform. (similar to the INDEX transform)
  - SET        : See the docs/TEMPLATE for explanation (Thanks to W. Nelis)
  - STATISTIC  : See the docs/TEMPLATE for explanation (Thanks to W. Nelis)

TODO                         
Priority 1: Sourceforge open and bugs
       Memory leaks
         On linux (WIP) 
         On BSD (major)
         One was in xymon-rrd, but should be fixed now? (version?) 
         Results: Minimized by fixing all errors: run devmon in foreground and show logs
       SNMPv3: After triing to use the work from StefCoene, it seem more complicated that what I tought...
       Document Transform Coltre, Sort


Ideas
       Warn if autovivification (creates the hash if it do not exists, but it should not) and check if it does already make problem 
       Make Table compatible with LEAF 
       Share templates for similar devices: Lot of work!!!
       Support for negative numbers in (T)SWITCH: Parse mathematical expression simply....: Need more work
       Format display (SUBSTR negative, Align columns of a TABLE to the right side,  Formatting of result of MATH transform): Problems Alignement and Padding
       Exceptions based on other oid values: now only PriOi: make it work for alternate oid
       Template exceptions sorted misleadingly: need documentation clarification
       Use OID value in threshold comparison: Nice to have (workaround is to do that is transform)

FEATURE REQUEST
       Better discovery (SF bug 10)
       Multiple graph in a test
       Add better timer calculation (HiRes)

HELP NEEDED
