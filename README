 What is Devmon ?
---------------------------------------

  Devmon is a Perl software that uses SNMP to monitor, graph and alert
  on host information

 What are Devmon's prerequisites?
---------------------------------------

  In order for Devmon to do anything useful, you will need a machine
  capable of running the Perl interpreter, which is used to execute the
  Devmon code.

  In addition, you will need a machine (either the same machine running
  Devmon, or a different one) running either the Hobbit/Xymon or
  BigBrother monitoring program, which displays the messages that Devmon
  generates.

  Finally, you will need your to have your Hobbit/Xymon or BigBrother
  program set up to monitor at least one host that Devmon has a template
  for. Only then will Devmon be able to poll a remote host and display
  the results. For more information on Devmon's template system, please
  consult the TEMPLATES file located in the docs directory.

 How do I install Devmon?
---------------------------------------

  Detailed instructions are available in the docs/INSTALLATION file. A
  single-node installation merely requires you to untar the Devmon
  tarball to a suitable location, modify the config file appropriately,
  and start the Devmon daemon.

  A multi-node installation requires you to do all of the above on each
  node in the cluster, as well as set up a MySQL database to facilitate
  communication between nodes.

 What are Devmon templates?
--------------------------------------

  Devmon can monitor a virtually unlimited number of different device
  types, by allowing a user to define a template for each test to be
  conducted on a particular device type. For instance, a 'cpu' test on a
  Cisco 2950 switch is its own template, while a 'if_load' test on the
  same switch is an entirely different template. A must read: the
  docs/TEMPLATES file!
