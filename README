 What is Devmon ?
---------------------------------------

  Devmon is a Perl software that uses SNMP to monitor, graph and alert 
  on host information

 What are Devmon's prerequisites?
---------------------------------------

  In order for Devmon to do anything useful, you will need
  a machine capable of running the Perl interpreter, which
  is used to execute the Devmon code.  

  In addition, you will need a machine (either the same machine 
  running Devmon, or a different one) runing either the Hobbit/Xymon 
  or BigBrother monitoring program, which displays the messages
  that Devmon generates.  

  Finally, you will need your to have your Hobbit/Xymon or BigBrother 
  program set up to monitor at least  one host that Devmon has 
  a template for.   Only then will Devmon be able to poll a 
  remote host and display the results.  For more information on 
  Devmon's template system, please consult the TEMPLATES file
  located in the docs directory.

 How do I install Devmon?
---------------------------------------

  Detailed instructions are available in the docs/INSTALLATION
  file.  A single-node installation merely requires you to untar
  the Devmon tarball to a suitable location, modify the config
  file appropriately, and start the Devmon daemon.  

  A multi-node installation requires you to do all of the above
  on each node in the cluster, as well as set up a MySQL database
  to facilitate communication between nodes.

 What are Devmon templates?
--------------------------------------

  Devmon can monitor a virtually unlimited number of different 
  device types, by allowing a user to define a template for
  each test to be conducted on a particular device type.
  For instance, a 'cpu' test on a Cisco 2950 switch is its own 
  template, while a 'if_load' test on the same switch is an
  entirely different template. A must read: the docs/TEMPLATES file!

TODO (will be moved)                         
Priority 1: Sourceforge open and bugs
       Memory leaks
         On linux (WIP) 
         On BSD (major)
         One was in xymon-rrd, but should be fixed now? (version?) 
         Results: Minimized by fixing all errors: run devmon in foreground and show logs
       SNMPv3: After triing to use the work from StefCoene, it seem more complicated that what I tought...
       Document Transform Coltre, Sort


Ideas
       Warn if autovivification (creates the hash if it do not exists, but it should not) and check if it does already make problem 
       Make Table compatible with LEAF 
       Share templates for similar devices: Lot of work!!!
       Support for negative numbers in (T)SWITCH: Parse mathematical expression simply....: Need more work
       Format display (SUBSTR negative, Align columns of a TABLE to the right side,  Formatting of result of MATH transform): Problems Alignement and Padding
       Exceptions based on other oid values: now only PriOi: make it work for alternate oid
       Template exceptions sorted misleadingly: need documentation clarification
       Use OID value in threshold comparison: Nice to have (workaround is to do that is transform)

FEATURE REQUEST
       Better discovery (SF bug 10)
       Multiple graph in a test
       Add better timer calculation (HiRes)

Document SORT Transform 
        To sort in an increasing order (num or txt, default = txt)
        oid values. The result (the new oid values) are
        int indexes corresponding to the position of the source
        oid values in the sort.
        The results are a int between 1 and n
        (n is the number of element in the branch oid)
        It can be used to 'reindex' an oid if use in conjonction with
                 the CHAIN transform. (similar to the INDEX transform)

HELP NEEDED
       Template not listed above cannot be test: please help to updated: take a look at template liste above that are maintained! 
       Template exceptions sorted misleadingly: need documentation clarification: I dont used it: I need concrate case!)
