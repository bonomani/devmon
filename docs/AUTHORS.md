# Authors

The project was created by Buchan Milne on February 23, 2006 on Sourceforge
(to my knowledge). I forked it on December 15, 2016 because there hasn't been
a new version since January 23, 2009, and many patches were pending: the
project seemed dead. I contacted the original author to let him know that I
was open to any form of collaboration. I am always open and I will remain.
