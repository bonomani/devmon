# Authors

The project was initially created by Buchan Milne on February 23, 2006, on Sourceforge. I forked it 
on the 15 December 2016, due to the lack of updates since January 23, 2009, and the accumulation of 
pending patches, indicating project inactivity. I reached out to the original author to express my 
openness to collaboration, a stance I maintain.
