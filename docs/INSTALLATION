  INSTALLING DEVMON
=====================================================================

For an overview of how Devmon works, please see the OVERVIEW file.

 Single-node installation
---------------------------------------------------------------------

  To install a single-node server, perform the following steps:

  1. Install the SNMP_Session Perl module (v1.08 or later), which
     you can download from: 
        http://www.switch.ch/misc/leinen/snmp/perl/

  2. Unpack the Devmon tarball into your preferred directory.  I
     typically use /usr/local/devmon, but it is totally up to you.

     Since templates are now shipped in a separate tarball, download
     the templates tarball and unpack it in the above directory,
     and if the resulting direcotry is not named 'templates', rename 
     it to be 'templates'.

  3. Edit the devmon.cfg file.  For a single node installation, the
     options you want to pay particular attention to are: 
     MULTINODE, BBHOSTS, SNMPCIDS, PIDFILE, BBTYPE & DISPSERV.  If
     you wish to modify the polling interval type (default is once
     a minute) you should also modify the CYCLETIME variable.

  4. Edit your bb-hosts file and add your Devmon tag (specified by
     BBTAG variable in the config file, defaults to 'DEVMON') to
     any of the hosts you want Devmon to monitor.  For instance:
        10.0.0.1        myrouter # badconn:1:1:2 DEVMON

     For detailed information on how to tweak Devmon on a
     per-device basis in your bb-hosts file, see the docs/USING
     file.

  5. Set up a cron job to run devmon with the --readbbhosts flag.
     The interval is up to you, but keep in mind that Devmon
     won't start monitoring a host until its been read from the 
     bb-hosts file.  I prefer once every 5 minutes:
        */5 * * * * /usr/local/devmon/devmon --readbbhosts

     If you are running Devmon on a different machine from your
     display server; this will require a little bit of trickery
     to make sure that Devmon has a fresh copy of the bb-hosts
     file to read from.  You could either have the bb-hosts file
     available on a network mount (via NFS of SMB), or use
     a passwordless SCP cronjob copy it from the display
     server immediately before you run Devmon with the
     --readbbhosts flag.

  6. Install startup scripts that will launch Devmon when 
     your machine boots.  A fedora-specific startup script
     has been included in the tarball, for your convenience.

  7. Start Devmon and inspect the logs for any oddities.
     If it doesn't immediately start logging errors of one
     sort or another, you should be done!  Check your display
     server and see if any of your new tests are being shown.

  8. For Hobbit users, if you desire, you can copy the 
     Devmon guide page ('devmon.html', located in the docs 
     directory) to the Hobbit help pages directory,
        '$HOBBIT/server/www/help/' 
     and add a link to it from the Hobbit help menu,
        '$HOBBIT/server/www/menu/menu_items.js'

     This might be a good idea if you have users that 
     edit the host file and need to familiarize themselves
     with the Devmon syntax and macros.

 Multi-node installation
---------------------------------------------------------------------

  Significantly more complicated than a single node setup,
  multi-node configuration offers you more speed & flexibility.

  Steps 1 through 6 should be performed on all on the machines in
  your Devmon cluster:

  NODE SETUP:
  
  1.  Install the SNMP_Session Perl module (v1.08 or later), which
      you can download from: 
         http://www.switch.ch/misc/leinen/snmp/perl/

  2.  Install the MySQL client and 'headers and libraries' packages, 
      v4.12 or later (5 recommended):
         http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql 

  3.  Install the DBI::MySQL Perl module:
         mynode# perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::DBD::mysql' 

      If you haven't used the CPAN module (or the CPAN command line 
      client) before, you will have to go through a few questions.  
      Alternatively, you can download and install the module from:
         http://www.cpan.org

  4.  Unpack the Devmon tarball into your preferred directory.  I
      typically use /usr/local/devmon, but it is totally up to you.

      Since templates are now shipped in a separate tarball, download
      the templates tarball and unpack it in the above directory,
      and if the resulting direcotry is not named 'templates', rename 
      it to be 'templates'.

  5.  Edit the devmon.cfg file, and modify the necessary local
      variables.  The options you want to pay particular attention 
      to are: MULTINODE, PIDFILE, LOGFILE, DBHOST, DBNAME, DBUSER & 
      DBPASS.  The database specific options should correspond to 
      the values you select in the 'database setup' section, below.

  6.  Install startup scripts that will launch Devmon when 
      your machine boots.  A fedora-specific startup script
      has been included in the tarball, for your convenience.


  DATABASE SERVER SETUP:

  Assuming that you are setting up a dedicated MySQL server for the
  Devmon cluster:

  7.  Download and install the MySQL server and client packages from: 
         http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/

      I would recommend the standard server, unless you plan on
      running MySQL in a clustered configuration.

  8.  Start the MySQL server and install any startup scripts neccesary
      to insure that it starts when the database machine boots.

  9.  Use the mysqladmin util to change the passwords for the root 
      user on your MySQL server:
         dbserv# mysqladmin -u root password 'CHANGETHIS'

      Replace "CHANGETHIS" with whatever you want to set your
      MySQL root password to, preserving the single quotes.
  
  10. Delete unneeded (and possibly insecure) default MySQL accounts:
         dbserv# mysql -p -e 'delete from mysql.user where password=""'

      This time it will ask you for the password that you provided in
      step #8.  DO NOT PERFORM THIS STEP IF YOU USE THIS MYSQL SERVER
      FOR SERVICES OTHER THAN DEVMON.  

  11. Create your devmon database (this corresponded to the value
      of the 'DBNAME' variable in your devmon.cfg file):
         dbserv# mysqladmin -p create 'DBNAME'

      Replace "DBNAME" with your preferred database name, preserving
      the single quotes.  I would recommend the default, 'devmon'. 

  12. Unpack the devmon tarball somewhere temporary on your database
      server (you wont need it after step #11).

  13. Import the Devmon database structure into your newly created
      Devmon database:
         dbserv# mysql -p devmon < /path/to/devmon/extras/devmon.db
  
  14. Remove the temporary directory where you unpacked the devmon
      tarball.

  15. Create the user that devmon will use to query the devmon
      database, assign it a password, and grant it access to the
      devmon database:
        dbserv# mysql -p -e 'grant all on DB.* to USER identified by "PW"'

      Replace "DB" with the database name that you selected in step #10.
      Replace "USER" with the username that you chose in your devmon.cfg
      file (default is 'devmon'). Replace "PW" with the password that
      you chose in your devmon.cfg file (preserve the double quotes),
      and use something other than the default 'devmon' for security.


  DISPLAY SERVER SETUP:

  On your display server: 

  16. Install the SNMP_Session Perl module (v1.08 or later), which
      you can download from: 
         http://www.switch.ch/misc/leinen/snmp/perl/

  17. Install the MySQL client and 'headers and libraries' packages, 
      v4.12 or later (5 recommended):
         http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql 

  18. Install the DBI::MySQL Perl module:
         display# perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::DBD::mysql' 

      If you haven't used the CPAN module (or the CPAN command line 
      client) before, you will have to go through a few questions.  
      Alternatively, you can download and install the module from:
         http://www.cpan.org

  19. Unpack the Devmon tarball into your preferred directory.  I
      typically use /usr/local/devmon, but it is totally up to you.

  20. Edit the devmon.cfg file.  The options you want to pay 
      attention to are: 
      MULTINODE, BBTAG, SNMPCIDS, DBHOST, DBNAME, DBUSER & DBPASS.
      The database specific options should correspond to the values 
      you selected in the 'database setup' section, above.

  21. Import your template data into your devmon database:
        display# /usr/local/devmon/devmon -v --synctemplates

  22. Edit your bb-hosts file and add your Devmon tag (specified by
      BBTAG variable in the config file, defaults to 'DEVMON') to
      any of the hosts you want Devmon to monitor.  For instance:
         10.0.0.1        myrouter # badconn:1:1:2 DEVMON

     For detailed information on how to tweak Devmon on a
     per-device basis in your bb-hosts file, see the docs/USING
     file.

  23. Set up a cron job to run devmon with the --readbbhosts flag.
      The interval is up to you, but keep in mind that Devmon
      won't start monitoring a host until its been read from the 
      bb-hosts file.  I prefer once every 5 minutes:
         */5 * * * * /usr/local/devmon/devmon --readbbhosts


  GLOBAL NODE CONFIG AND STARTUP:

  24. On one of your devmon nodes (it doesn't matter which), edit
      your devmon.cfg and change the global variables to your liking.
      The variables that you want to pay the most attention to are:
      BBTYPE, DISPSERV & CYCLETIME.

  25. Synchronize your global config:
         mynode# /usr/local/devmon/devmon -v --syncconfig

  26. Start all devmon nodes:
         /usr/local/devmon/devmon

      Observe logs for any odd behavior.

  27. For Hobbit users, if you desire, you can copy the 
      Devmon guide page ('devmon.html', located in the docs 
      directory) to the Hobbit help pages directory:
         '$HOBBIT/server/www/help/' 
      and add a link to it from the Hobbit help menu,
         '$HOBBIT/server/www/menu/menu_items.js'

      This might be a good idea if you have users that 
      edit the host file and need to familiarize themselves
      with the Devmon syntax and macros.

  consult the docs/MULTINODE file.
