<h3><a name="tags">Devmon tags in the bb-hosts file</a></h3>

<p>Once Devmon is installed and running, and you have a cron 
job running Devmon with the --readbbhosts flag periodically, 
you can begin monitoring remote hosts by adding the devmon
tag to their entry in your bb-hosts file.</p>

<p>A example of a typical entry in your bb-hosts file for
a host being monitored by devmon might look like:</p>

<pre>
    10.0.0.1        myrouter # badconn:1:1:2 NAME:"My router" DEVMON
</pre>

<p>In this case, the 'DEVMON' tag is what tells Devmon that it should
monitor this host.  If this Devmon has not monitored this host
in the past, it will attempt to auto-discover the devices vendor
and model type, which will then tell Devmon which test templates it
should run against this device.  Unless otherwise specified,
Devmon will run all tests available for a given vendor and model.</p>

<p>For example, Devmon comes, by default, with eight templates
for a Cisco 2950 switch (these being cpu, power, fans, if_col,
if_dsc, if_err, if_load and if_stat).  If you have a 2950 switch in 
your bb-hosts file and add a DEVMON tag to it, Devmon will 
auto-discover it as a Cisco 2950, and run all eight test templates
against that switch, and report the results back to the display
server.</p>

<p>For more info on templates, please see the docs/TEMPLATES file.</p>

<h3><a name="options">Using options with a Devmon tag</a></h3>

<p>There are a number of options that you can supply to Devmon via
the bb-hosts tag.  They are:</p>

<pre>
    cid()     : Specifies that this device uses a SNMP Community ID 
                other than the ones specified in the SNMPCIDS 
                variable in the devmon.cfg file

    port()    : Define a custom UDP SNMP port for this device
                (other than the default port of 161)

    model()   : Set the vendor and model of this device, instead of
                having to rely on autodetection for it (SNMP cid
                will still be autodetected, however)

    tests()   : Specifies that Devmon should only run certain tests
                against this device

    thresh()  : Overrides the default thresholds for a single OID
                on a single test.

    except()  : Overrides the default exceptions for one or more
                tests performed on this device.
</pre>


<p>All of the above options are case sensitive, so 'CID()' wont work
if you use it. If you do use any of the options, they need to 
immediately follow the Devmon tag, separated by only a colon
(no whitespace!).  If you use multiple options, they should
be separated by commas.  For instance:</p>

<pre>
    DEVMON:cid(mysnmpid)
      and
    DEVMON:tests(cpu,power)
      and
    DEVMON:tests(power,fans,cpu),cid(testcid)
      and
    DEVMON:tests(cpu),thresh(cpu;CPUTotal5Min;y:50;r:90)
</pre>


<p>...are all valid uses of the Devmon tag.  These, however:</p>

<pre>
    DEVMON:
      or
    DEVMON: tests(power)
      or
    DEVMON:tests (power)
</pre>

<p>...are all invalid, due to an superfluous colon in the first
example, and unnecessary whitespace in the other two.</p>



<h3><a name='optexm'>Devmon tag option examples</a></h3>

<p>Examples on how to use Devmon tag options are as follows:</p>

<a name='cidexm'></a>
    <b>cid()</b> 
<pre>
      Assuming that you had set your SNMPCIDS variable in your
      devmon.cfg file to 'snmpcid1,snmpcid2', and you had a
      host that only responded to a SNMP cid 'uniqueID', you could 
      modify the Devmon tag for this host with this option:

        badconn:1:1:2 DEVMON:cid(uniqueID)

</pre>

<a name='portexm'></a>
    <b>port()</b>
<pre>
      Define a custom UDP SNMP port for this device
      (other than the default port of 161)

</pre>

<a name='modelexm'></a>
    <b>model()</b>
<pre>
      Use this option to override the autodetection of the vendor and
      model when doing the initial autodiscovery.  The arguments for
      this option should be the vendor and model, separated by a
      semicolon:

        DEVMON:model(cisco;2950)

</pre>

<a name='testsexm'></a>
    <b>tests()</b>
<pre>
      If you only want to run a certain subset of the tests provided 
      by a devices templates, you can use the tests tag like so:

        DEVMON:tests(cpu,if_err)

      This will cause Devmon to only run the cpu and if_err tests for
      this host.

</pre>

<a name='threxm'></a>
    <b>thresh()</b>
<pre>
      Useful for changing the default thresholds specified by
      a device's templates, the thresh() option requires you to specify
      the test, oid, and threshold values that you want to override.
      These values should be encased in the option parentheses,
      semicolon delimited, and in the following order:

        test;object-identifier;color_definition1;color_definition2;etc...

      You can override one, some, or all of the color thresholds
      on a particular test.  The color definitions should start
      with a single letter (signifying the color to be redefined,
      'r' is red, 'y' is yellow, 'g' is green), followed by an equals
      sign and the new value of the color threshold.  So, redefining
      the red and yellow thresholds for test 'foo', object id 'bar',
      to '95' and '60', respectively, would look like:

        DEVMON:thresh(foo;bar;r:95;y:60)

      If you wanted to redefine the green threshold as well:
  
        DEVMON:thresh(foo;bar;r:95;y:60;g:10)

      You can string together threshold redefinitions for multiple 
      test/oids in a a single thresh option, by separating them with
      with commas:

        DEVMON:thresh(foo;opt1;r:80,foo;opt2;r:90)
        
      Some examples of practical uses:

      Changing the 'output load' of a APC UPS:

        DEVMON:thresh(power;upsLoadOut;y:75;r:90)
      
      Changing the collision thresholds on a Cisco switch:

        DEVMON:thresh(if_col;ifOutColPct;y:90;r:98)

      Threshold overrides can be used on either non-repeater type oids
      (i.e the output load on a ups) or repeater type oids (such as
      the collisions percent or interface load on all of the interfaces
      on a switch).

      If you are having trouble finding the particular oid to override,
      try looking in the test template directory of the vendor/model
      of your device.  The 'messages' file should contain the name of
      the you want to override, and the 'thresholds' file should
      contain the default values of the oid.  For more information, 
      please see the docs/TEMPLATES file.

      Keep in mind that Devmon attempts to match thresholds in order
      from highest severity to lowest severity (the severity list
      being: red->yellow->clear->green).  If more than one threshold
      matches, the highest is considered to be the most accurate.

      Numeric vs Non-numeric thresholds:
      ---------------------------------

      One important thing to note about thresholds is that they
      are lumped into one of two categories: numeric and non-numeric.

      Numeric thresholds should consist of only numbers, possibly
      preceded by one of the following logical math operators:
        >    (greater than)
        <    (less than)
        >=   (greater than or equal to)
        <=   (less than or equal to)
        =    (equal to)

      If no math operator is defined in the threshold, Devmon assumes
      that it is a 'greater than' type threshold.  That is, if the 
      value obtained via SNMP is greater than this threshold value, the
      the threshold is considered to be met and devmon will deal with
      it accordingly.

      Some examples of numeric thresholds:

       Set the yellow and red collision thresholds to greater than
       40 and 80 %, respectively.  Note that the red threshold has
       a greater than symbol and the yellow doesn't, but they are
       effectively the same:

         DEVMON:thresh(if_col;ifOutColCt;y:40;r:>80)
 
       Set the red collision threshold to greater than or equal to 75%
       Note that this does not modify the templates default yellow value:

         DEVMON:thresh(if_col;ifOutColPct;r:>=75)
      
       Set the red uptime threshold on a switch to less than or equal to
       5 minutes (300 seconds) (uptime is measured in the cpu test):
        
         DEVMON:thresh(cpu;sysUpTimeSecs;r:<=300)


       If a threshold value contains even one non-numeric character 
       (other than the math operators illustrated above), it is 
       considered a non-numeric threshold.  Non-numeric thresholds are 
       treated as regular expressions, and devmon tries to match
       them against the value of the data contained in the oid that
       the threshold is applied against.

       For example, to cause an APC UPS to throw a red alarm only
       when its output status is 'On battery' (the template default
       is 'On battery', 'Off', or 'Bypass'), use the following options:

         DEVMON:thresh(power;upsOutStat;r:On battery)

       Regular expressions in threshold matches are non-anchored, 
       which means they can match any substring of the compared data.
       So, the following DEVMON definition:

         DEVMON:thresh(power;upsFailCause;y:voltage)

       Would mean the following values would cause a yellow alarm: 
         High line voltage
           and
         Small momentary voltage sag
           and
         Small momentary voltage spike
           ...etc.   

       So be careful how you define your thresholds, as you could 
       match more than you intend to!  If you want to make sure your
       pattern matches explicitly, precede it with a '^' and terminate
       it with a '$', ie:

         DEVMON:thresh(power;upsFailCause;y:^High line voltage$)

       This would cause the yellow alarm to be raised only when
       the 'upsFailCause' oid matches 'High line voltage' exactly.

       Note that since these are regular expressions, you can perform
       all sorts of complicated pattern matching.  For more detailed
       information on regular expressions, consider visiting this 
       website:

       ... or purchasing the book 'Mastering Regular Expressions',

<a name='excexm'></a>
     <b>except()</b>
<pre>
       Used for overriding the default exceptions of a devices 
       templates, the except() option is only useful for repeater type 
       oids.   Also, it is only valid for the first oid in a repeater 
       table (the 'primary' oid).  

       There are four exception types, with corresponding option
       abbreviations: 

         The 'only' exception (abbreviated as 'o'), which causes only 
         rows with a matching primary oid to be displayed.

         The 'ignore' exception (abbreviated as 'i'), which causes
         only rows with a NON-matching primary oid to be displayed.

         The 'alarm on' exception (abbreviated as 'ao').  This 
         exception doesn't effect what rows are displayed, but
         rather causes only rows with a matching primary oid to
         be capable of generating alarms (that is all other rows,
         regardless of their status, will be considered 'green'.

         The 'no alarm' exception (abbreviated as 'na').  The 
         inverse of the alarm on exception, this allows only
         rows that have a NON-matching primary oid to be able
         to generate alarms.

       Like the non-numeric thresholds described above, exception 
       values are regular expressions.  Exceptions differ, however,
       in that they are anchored, which means that they must match 
       your oid value exactly.  This means if you have an oid
       with a 

       So, an example: You have a template set up to monitor ifc 
       status (test name: if_stat), and in your repeater oid
       table your primary oid is the interface name (ifName).
       Your template is set up by default to display all interfaces, 
       but to only alarm on Gigabit interfaces. However, on a 
       particular switch, you want to alarm only on Fast Ethernet 
       interfaces 48 and 49.  You could accomplish this with the 
       follow bb-hosts entry:

         DEVMON:except(if_stat;ifName;ao:Fa0/48|Fa0/49)

       Since exceptions are regular expressions, you could have
       have used a regexp shortcut, like so:

         DEVMON:except(if_stat;ifName;ao:Fa0/4[8-9])

       Exceptions can also be applied across multiple tests, using
       the 'all' test type.  This is handy if you have multiple
       tests that use the same primary oid for their tables, and
       you want to make sure that only a particular primary oid
       generated values for all of the tests (the if_* series
       of tests comes immediately to mind).  

       So, for instance, if you had a switch that was running
       the if_err, if_stat and if_load tests, and you wanted
       to make sure that Devmon only alarmed on Gigabit
       interfaces 0/1 and 0/2, you could use the following:

         DEVMON:except(all;ifName;ao:Gi0/[1-2])

       One last example; if you had a switch and you didn't
       want to display any of the Vlan, Null or Loopback
       interfaces, you could use a DEVMON tag like this:

         DEVMON:except(all;ifName;i:Vl.*|Lo.*|Nu.*)
