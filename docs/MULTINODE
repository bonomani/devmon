 DESIGNING A ROBUST MULTINODE CLUSTER
======================================================================

    There are a number of considerations you need to make when creating
  a multi-node devmon cluster.  The first, and most important, is:


 How fast do you want to poll your hosts?
--------------------------------------------------------------------- 

    Speed will probably be the driving reason why most people will
  resort to using a multi-node cluster.  A single machine, regardless
  of its processor speed or network connection, will only be able
  to poll so many devices before it exceeds what you deem to be
  an acceptable poll interval (We prefer to poll once per 60 seconds).

    If you are absolutely die-hard about polling under a certain
  interval, I would recommend creating a cluster in which all of
  the machines had an average poll-time of half your acceptable
  poll interval.  This way, you could lose up to have the machines
  in your cluster, and still stay under the poll time (hopefully).

    Our Devmon cluster consists of seven nodes, poll a total of
  ~800 devices, with an average of 720 tests per node.  Each
  node takes ~45 seconds to complete its polling cycle.  Our nodes
  are all P4 2.00GHz systems, running Fedora Core 4 (Hyperthreading
  disabled).  So, if you wanted to poll 2000 devices on similar
  hardware, in 60 seconds or less, I would recommend having at
  least 15 nodes.

 
 What type of hardware do I need to run Devmon?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, if you aren't concerned about speed, Devmon will run on just
  about anything, as long as it is capable of running the Perl
  interpreter.  That being said, the main bottleneck for the poll 
  nodes is processor speed (although network latency comes in a close
  second).  Devmon benefits from the fastest CPUs available, and
  can take advantage of multiple processors.  So if you are hell-bent
  on speed, throw a couple of 3+ GHz, 2-way servers into your 
  devmon cluster, and see how it runs.

    That being said, Devmon assumes that all of the polling nodes in
  your cluster are running similar (if not identical) hardware.  So
  they will split the tests evenly amongst themselves, and if you
  have a 386 in a cluster with a bunch of p4s, the 386 is going to
  take much, much longer to finish its polling cycles.

    Since RAID, hdd speed and general system redundancy are not an
  issue in a devmon cluster (the cluster itself provides redundancy),
  we have found that the best price-point per node is to use high-end
  desktop machines for the polling devices.  This gives you the best
  bang-for-your buck processor wise, without taxing your budget with
  things that Devmon wont need (RAID, SCSI, dual power supplies, etc).

    Now the machine running your database, that is another issue
  all together.  This machine is the backbone of your Devmon cluster;
  if it explodes, you lose everything (making your MySQL server
  a redundant cluster is covered below).   Your DB machines is what
  devmon uses for all coordination between the nodes, so it needs
  to be as fast as possible.  Processor speed isn't as much an 
  issue here as hdd access speeds, network latency, and memory
  capacity.  For a larger database, I would suggest a DB machine
  with RAID 01/10 (not RAID 5, which causes performance problems
  for a DB machine) running (in order of preferrence), SAS, 
  SCSI or SATA disks.  I'd recommend a minimum of 1 GB of memory,
  the more the better.

    As for operating systems, I can't claim to have run the
  multi-node version of Devmon on anything other than Linux.  MySQL
  can run on Mac OS X, Solaris, and FreeBSD (although BSD, at this
  time, is not supported by the MySQL developers).  The Devmon nodes
  themselves can run on just about any OS capable of running Perl,
  but the database, at the moment, should probably run on Linux. 


 How does the cluster operate?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

  Here's a small diagram that describes your typical Devmon cluster:

     +-----------+      +--------------+      +-----------------+ 
     |           |<---->|   Node #1    |----->|                 |
     |           |      +--------------+      |                 |
     |           |      +--------------+      |     Display     | 
     |  Database |<---->|   Node #2    |----->|     Server      |
     |           |      +--------------+      |                 |
     |           |      +--------------+      |   +-------------+      
     |           |<---->|   Node #3    |----->|   | readbbhosts | 
     +-----------+      +--------------+      +-----------------+
           ^                                            |
           ---------------------------------------------+   

  So, you can see the bi-directional traffic that goes on between
  the nodes and the database server (test/device assignments, load
  balancing, heartbeats, etc), the unidirectional traffic between
  the nodes and the display server (test messages), and the
  unidirectional flow between the display server at the database
  (the devmon --readbbhosts cron job, which adds and deletes
  devices from the Devmon database, based on what it sees in the
  bb-hosts file on the display server).


 How do I make my database (and thus my cluster) fully redundant?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

  MySQL 4.1 introduced a new feature, called MySQL clustering, that
  can make a MySQL cluster completely redundant.  It has only gotten
  better since its introduction, and its fairly robust these days.

  Anyways, it involves splitting a MySQL database into three separate
  process groups:  the management process, the storage node processes, 
  and the database processes.  More documentation on the nitty-gritty
  of the MySQL cluster architecture is available on the MySQL
  website.

  My recommended "fully redundant" MySQL/Devmon architecture would
  involve having a dedicated low-end box for the MySQL management
  process (it doesn't even have to be on all the time, but it is
  necessary for bring new storage and database nodes online), 
  two beefy RAID servers for the storage node processes, and then 
  running individual MySQL servers on each of your devmon nodes.

  The end product might look something like this:

 +-------+                +----- Node 1------+
 |Manager|--              |        |         |
 +-------+ |    ----------| MySQL < > Devmon |----------
           |    |         |        |         |         |
           |    |         +------------------+         |
           |    |                                      |
           |    |                                      |
   +----------------+     +----- Node 2------+         |
   |                |     |        |         |        +----------------+
   | Storage Node 1 |-----| MySQL < > Devmon |--------|                |
   |                |     |        |         |        |                |
   +----------------+     +------------------+        |                |
           |                                          |     Display    |
           |                                          |     Server     |
   +----------------+     +----- Node 3------+        |                |
   |                |     |        |         |        |                |
   | Storage Node 2 |-----| MySQL < > Devmon |--------|                |
   |                |     |        |         |        +----------------+
   +----------------+     +------------------+         |
                |                                      |
                |                                      |
                |         +----- Node 1------+         |
                |         |        |         |         |
                ----------| MySQL < > Devmon |----------
                          |        |         |
                          +------------------+

  I'll leave the details of the cluster as an exercise to the reader,
  but hopefully this little bit of information is enough to get you
  on the right track.  For more information on MySQL and MySQL
