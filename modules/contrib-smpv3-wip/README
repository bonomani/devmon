This WIP seems to partially work
- Some value are note correctly returned?
- Timout on some values
- 2x slower in snmpv2c...

To test it simply put the content of this directory in modules !

Install source:
Centos:
yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
yum install perl-Net-SNMP
